# Eat-Away

This is an app that suggests places to eat using user inputs such as their favorite foods or any food that they are in the mood for. This app will ask for user inputs and search on google map for places that match those inputs. The goal of this app is to help users quickly search for places to eat while tailoring the search result to the either users' inputs or their account settings.
